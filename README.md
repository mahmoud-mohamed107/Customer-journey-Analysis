In contrast, **monthly users engage more with Career Tracks**, indicating a preference for structured, short-term learning paths that could be leveraged for upsell opportunities. Additionally, **the Resource Center appears slightly more in annual users'** journeys, but rather than influencing purchase decisions, it seems to be a post-subscription engagement tool.

# Recommendations  

## Make the Pricing Page Work Harder  
- Since annual users hit the Pricing page early, let’s make it as persuasive as possible. Clear value propositions, side-by-side plan comparisons, and strong CTAs can nudge them toward a decision faster.  
- A/B test different layouts and messaging to see what drives more conversions.  
- Use testimonials, retargeting ads, personalized email follow-ups, or limited-time offers to push the customers that check out the Pricing page but don’t convert.  

## Turn Career Tracks into a Conversion Tool  
- Monthly users love Career Tracks, so we can use that to our advantage. Highlight how structured learning paths help them reach their goals faster.  

## Make the Resource Center a Retention Powerhouse  
- Annual users seem to spend more time here. so We can personalize content recommendations, send reminders about useful resources, and showcase success stories.
